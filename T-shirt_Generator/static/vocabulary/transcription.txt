happy
ants in one's pants
the birds and the bees 
cat nap
cat's got one's tongue
chicken out
clam up
copy cat
dog days
dropping like flies
eager beaver
fishy
have a cow 
hold your horses
holy cow!
horse around
get the lion's share
in the dog house
kill two birds with one stone
kitty corner
let the cat out of the bag
little bird told me
make a beeline
monkey see, monkey do
nest egg
pig out
raining cats and dogs
rat race 
smell a rat
straight from the horse's mouth
take the bull by the horns
until the cows come home
all ears
break a leg 
cold feet
cost an arm and a leg
cry your heart out
face the music
flesh and blood
get something off one's chest
give a hand, lend a hand
have one's head in the clouds
head over heels 
head start
in over one's head 
keep an eye on
keep one's chin up
learn by heart, know by heart
let one's hair down
lips are sealed
makes my blood boil
neck of the woods 
old hand
over my dead body
pat on the back
play something by ear
pull one's leg 
rule of thumb
see eye to eye
skin of one's teeth
stick your neck out
sweet tooth
thick in the head
wash one's hands of something
beet red
black and blue 
black and white
black out
black sheep
born with a silver spoon in one's mouth
catch red handed
golden opportunity
grass is always greener on the other side
grey area, gray area 
the green light
green with envy 
green thumb
have the blues
in the dark
in the red
once in a blue moon
out of the blue
red tape 
red eye
roll out the red carpet
rose coloured glasses
see red 
tickled pink
true colours
white lie
with flying colours
at the drop of a hat
bee in one's bonnet 
below the belt
bursting at the seams
caught with one's pants down
card up one's sleeve
buckle down
burn a hole in one's pocket
dress to kill, dress to the nines 
fit like a glove 
fine-tooth comb
fly by the seat of one's pants
handle with kid gloves
apple of one's eye
bun in the oven
bad egg
big cheese
bread and butter
bring home the bacon
brownie points
butter someone up
cake and eat it too
carrot top 
cheesy
cool as a cucumber 
cream of the crop
don't cry over spilled milk
cup of joe
not my cup of tea
egg someone on
freeze one's buns off
full of beans
gravy train
have something handed to someone on a silver platter 
hard nut to crack
hot potato
in a nutshell
nuts about something, someone 
out to lunch
one smart cookie
peach fuzz 
piece of cake
put all of ones eggs in one basket
souped up
sell like hot cakes
spice things up
spill the beans
take something with a pinch grain of salt
use your noodle
cloud nine
dig deep 
dirt cheap
down to earth
fair-weather friend
a field day
go downhill
go with the flow
hit the hay
hit the road
keep one's head above water
know which way the wind blows
make a mountain out of a molehill
out of the woods 
over the hill
rain on someone else's parade
stick-in-the-mud
as quick as lightning
the tip of the iceberg
take a raincheck
under the weather
up the creek
win by a landslide
wind of something
